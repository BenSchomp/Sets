[ ] no @show or @giveup
  + everything should be off of: @sets
    @sets found
    @sets stop
    etc.
[ ] nice github readme, link to it in help
[ ] allow dupes for an 'easy' mode again
[ ] create scoring variations (even, progressive, or per set difference)

[x] allow multiple guess via : or @found
[x] redo scoring.
  is -2 too harsh? hard to recover from.
  thinking sliding scale for correct anwsers:
    first 50% = +1
    next 30% = +2
    next 20% = +3
    last one = +5

    so 6 sets would score:
      1,1,1,2,3,5
[ ] a --verbose mode
  mike: wef[ x ][x x][xxx] good for +1 point, 0 total.   (1 Set remaining)
  mike: des[ o ][o o][o o] wrong for -2 points, -1 total.   (failed: number, color)
[ ] ! how to filter out 3 char chatting? !
  possibly preface answers with : or a ,
[ ] consider progressive scoring or variable score based on set disimilarity
[x] get rid of directed replies ('benji: Game over!' becomes 'Game over!')
[ ] vfound/vunfound should only display 3 or 4 per row?
[ ] find ctrl chars for hard cards!
[x] disallow not implemented modes

[x] lock down commands:
    @sets, @done, @found, @redraw?, @showfound?, @score?

[ ] two add'l modes:
    [ ] only allow one (multi) guess from each player
        [ ] restrict guessing to private msgs? how?
        [ ] no 'found' list/command
        [ ] don't remove from sets list - each player gets the same shot at the board
        [ ] bonus points for get all in one shot?
        [ ] is time a factor? probably don't need to be threaded, just timestamp math
    [ ] draw new cards when a player finds a set
        [ ] allow only single guesses?
        [ ] what about timing issues where player guesses right after new cards are drawn?
        [ ] no 'found' list
        [ ] have to find all new sets, but why? just call isASet when player guesses
        [ ] play to some number, like 10?

[x] handle: '@show rem' correctly - right now the 3 char regex gives a -2
[ ] do we need a vall?
[x] handle boards with no sets
[x] change default to use guide, getopt should now be --noguide
[x] change default to use lefty (try a righty)
[/] allow getopts without class, ie @sets --hard --split

[ ] persistent scoring?
[ ] allow multiple/simultaneous games?
